    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    
    // team[3] = 'Lux';
    // console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team2);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    // console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(person, cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    console.log(person, cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. 
    // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const dev = {
      name: 'Dev',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@1234Dev',
        facebook: '1234Dev'
      }
    };

    // Since it is 1 level deep copy it gives reference of the social object 
    // hence the objects inside social change for both
    const dev1 = Object.assign({}, wes);
    // dev1.social.twitter = '@123Dev';
    // console.log(dev, dev1);

    // This converts the object to JSON string and then again parses it to an object 
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(dev));
    dev2.social.twitter = '@12Dev';
    console.log(dev, dev2);
